This file uses a Product Data Context file and a Netlify function.

I am in the process of adding a second context file to handle the state of the items in the cart. 

The two buttons in the header (Favorites and Cart) are unfinished. Clicking the Cart Button brings up a modal which will eventually display the contents of the cart.The Favorites button currently does nothing, but will eventually display a list of products the user marked as favorites by clicking the heart icon on a product.
